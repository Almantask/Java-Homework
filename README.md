# Chapter 1. Homework: Cooking and Conversions

## Introduction

There are 2 main measurement systems to this day: Imperial and Metric.
This is especially apparent comparing amount and quantity measurements in America and Europe.

Trying to make sense reading amounts in a recipe might be really tricky:

- 1/5 TSP = 1 ML
- 1 TSP = 5 ML
- 1 TBSP = 15 ML
- 1 FL OUNCE = 30 ML
- 1 CUP = 237 ML
- 1 PINT (2 CUPS) = 473 ML
- 1 QUART (4 CUPS) = .95 LITER
- 1 GALLON (16 CUPS) = 3.8 LITERS
- 1 OZ = 28 GRAMS
- 1 POUND = 454 GRAMS

You need to implement a function which does the conversions for cooking amounts.

## Cooking Measurement (VERY EASY)

Create a class called `CookingMeasurement`. Publicly, it should only have 2 methods: `float getAmount()`, `String getUnit()`.
It should be created using a public constructor that takes amount and unit.

## Units and Amounts (VERY EASY)

Create a class `Cooking`.

### Units (VERY EASY)

Inside a cooking class, create a static class called `Units`.
Define all the measurement units inside this class.
Have metrics for: OZ, POUND, GALLON, QUART, PINT, CUP, FL_OUNCE, TBSP, TSP.
Use `public static final String` for every declaration.

Also, create a method `String[] getValues()` to return all the known units. You will need this for the next steps.

### Amounts (VERY EASY)

Inside a cooking class, add one more static class called `Amounts`.
Each amount should translate to ML (including ML itself = 1).
Use the same constant syntax.
For example:
```
public static final float TSP = 5;
public static final float ML = 1;
```

## Get ready for conversions (VERY EASY)

Create a class CookingMeasurementConverter, which has a static method `CookingMeasurement convert(CookingMeasurement originalMeasurement, String unit)`

## Basic conversion (EASY)

For now, `convert` just supports TSP to ML conversion.

## More conversions (EASY)

Add the remaining conversions to ML: OZ, POUND, GALLON, QUART, PINT, CUP, FL_OUNCE, TBSP, TSP.

Hint: create a function which uses a switch statement for checking for unit and then returning the right amount for it.
That function should be place in `Amounts` class.

## Console conversion (MEDIUM)

Create a class called `ReceipePrompt`, with a public method `void run()`, which calls two private methods: 
`void promptAmount()` and `void promptUnit()` that reads both the amount and the unit for cooking measurement.
A user should see a prompt to enter those and in case invalid (not existing unit, negative amount) is entered, 
a retry to enter it should be asked again.

Hint: give user freedom and make sure capitalization does not matter. Use `toUpper()`.

Hint: to check if the unit is valid, use the `getValues` function from the `Units` class.

Hint: you can add one more function in the `Units` class `boolean isValid(String unit)` to check if the inputed String is a valid unit.

## Two-way conversion (HARD)

In `convert` function, add support for converting from/to every known unit described previously. 

Hint: use the function from *More Conversions* step (with a switch statement) to getAmount
amount of original measurement and measurement you need to convert it to, take their ration and multiple it original amount from that ratio. 

## Menu (MEDIUM)

Update `ReceipePrompt` class `Run()` method. It no longer does the two prompts.
Instead, it prints a menu first:

```
1 - basic conversion of a measurement
2 - receipe processing
```

User is prompted to select either option 1 or 2. Selecting option 1 does the same as before (basic conversion).
Selecting option 2 prints "to be implemented" in the console (in red).

Hint: don't forget to reset the console color after it prints text in red.

## Recipe conversion (VERY HARD)

Implement the option 2 in menu selection.
User pastes a recipe in the console and it should convert that to have all measurements in ML.

Algorithm:
1. Split input recipe by " " (space).
2. Run a for loop for every word split
3. If a word is a number...
4. ..Check what is the next word...
5. ..If the word that follows a number is a known measurement (using the function that you already made)...
6. ..Go back to the number, parse it, and convert it to ML...
7. ..And change the word after number to ML.

## Future- refactor using enum (MEDIUM)
