# Computer Factories

## Background

Microsoft and Mac have been long competing on the desktop market. Both are well known and respected computer makers.
Actually, they are not that different too, because the general flow of how they assemble computers is exactly the same for both computer factories:

  1. Select a Case
  2. Open a case
  3. Plant motherboard in a case
  4. Plant a ram
  5. Plant a cpu
  6. Plant a gpu
  7. Close a case
  8. Install OS

The major difference is, however, the way individual step is performed. Mac and Windows don't share the branding, so each installs their own branded parts. Same goes for the operating system.

## Your task

Create a factory for each: Mac and Microsoft and simulate how a computer is assembled reusing the flow acccross factories.
