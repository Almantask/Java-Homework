## Custom List (of int)

A list is a data structure which dynamically adjusts its' own size.
List has the following signature methods:

- add(int number) - adds a number at the end of a list;
- removeAt(int index)- removes number at specified index of a list;
- getAll()- gets all elements inside the list
- any()- returns true if list has any elements

List can be created either empty or by taking an array of int.

Implement a custom list.
