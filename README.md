# Pokemons

## What is a Pokemon?

Pokemon is a create which can attack. Its attack evolves with every new level.

## Your task

There are three level 1 pokemons: Pikachu, Snorlack and Hypnotoad.
Their attacks for each level are as follows:

L1:
- Pikachu can do a slash with a tail
- Snorlack punches
- Hypnotoad sends a psycho attack

L2: 
- Pikachu also does a lightining attack
- Snorlack also sends a psycho attack
- Hynotoad also slashes with a tail

L3: 
- Pikachu also sends a psycho attack
- Snorlack also sleeps an enemy
- Hypnotoad also confuses an enemy

Sleep and confusion are just changers of a boolean flag on another pokemon.
Attacks reduce hp of another pokemon.

Implement all 3 pokemons and their 3 levels with the least possible code.
