## Slowest key steps

- 1.Step create validation to check if releaseTimes should be not null, not empty;
KeysPressed should be not null, not empty, not whitespace and same length as the releaseTimes.
- 2.Step create int and for duration(because duration [0] will always be correct) and for char.
- 3.Step create loop and use length of input array and int i should start from 1 because 0 is already defined in previous step.
- 4.Step find loop all release times and then inside the loop create if statement to check if curration duration is equal
to duration in a loop also use or(||) to check if current duration is equal to duration found in loop and
if there is the same key in String keysPressed which are current assigned.
- 5.Step if any of the if statements are correct assign current duration to duration which you gonna need to for
to return correct keysPressed which also should be assigned everytime if statement is met.
- 6.Step return correct value.
